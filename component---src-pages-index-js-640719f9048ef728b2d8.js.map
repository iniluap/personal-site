I specialize in Vue.js, digital accessibility, and working\n        with complex legacy codebases. I'm passionate about well-written and\n        well-organised code, inclusive design, and ensuring that every feature I\n        build works seamlessly with assistive technologies.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        <strong>\n          I'm expanding my practice to examine the social implications of AI\n          systems and digital products.\n        </strong>{' '}\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        As someone who's implemented features at scale, I've become increasingly\n        interested in the language used to market and explain AI - how these\n        linguistic choices shape public perception, encode power dynamics, and\n        obscure technical realities. As someone who could build these systems,\n        I'm choosing to critically analyze them instead.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        I'm particularly focused on AI discourse: the anthropomorphization in\n        chatbot interfaces, the promises made by AI companion marketing, and how\n        narratives about AI \"taking over\" jobs and the world can overshadow\n        present-day social issues - like impacts on mental health, labor\n        practices, and community connection - that we could actually address and\n        mitigate now.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        I'm currently pursuing coursework in sociolinguistics and sociology at\n        the University of Warsaw, preparing for{' '}\n        <abbr title=\"International Association of Accessibility Professionals\">\n          IAAP\n        </abbr>{' '}\n        certification, and conducting independent research on digital discourse\n        that I'll be publishing on this site.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        Before tech, I studied English philology with a focus on\n        sociolinguistics and taught ESL. I've always been interested in how\n        language shapes power and perception - now I'm applying that lens to the\n        systems I know best.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"m-top-4\">\n        I believe engineers need critical literacy about the social weight of\n        their technical decisions. The interfaces we build aren't neutral.\n        They're linguistic and social systems that shape how millions of people\n        understand themselves and their world.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["ExternalLinkStyles","styled","ExternalLink","href","text","target","rel","className","icon","faUpRightFromSquare","IndexPage","title"],"sourceRoot":""}
