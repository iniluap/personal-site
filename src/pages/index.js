        Hi! My name is Paulina. I am a self-taught frontend developer. Since
        2017, I have been involved in various projects creating landing-pages,
        websites and web applications. Since 2020, I have been working on an
        enterprise Angular application, as one of the two frontend engineers. I
        do not shy away from learning new frameworks or content management
        systems. I also help out with backend related topics and QA processes.

        I've been a volunteer at a non-profit, where I organized youth camps,
        workshops, and trainings, leading educational exercises on human rights,
        diversity, sustainable development, and peaceful conflict resolution.
        I've also co‑organized{' '}

        I'm passionate about interior design and minimalism. On my perfect day
        off I would sit on the balcony, with a book in hand and my dog nearby.
