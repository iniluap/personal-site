                I have developed highly customised <strong>WordPress platforms</strong> with in-house PHP framework.
                I&nbsp;am currently part of a&nbsp;team working on advanced landing-page platform based on Angular & rxjs stack.
                I&nbsp;am responsible for turning top-notch designs into pixel-perfect components
                with optimisations for better UX.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use broad technical stack that involves:

            <ul>
                <li>SASS with SMACCS methodology</li>
                <li>JavaScript with TypeScript, ES5 & ES6 standards and jQuery</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                I comply with the coding standards with static analysis and linters.
                I&nbsp;take part in in-house knowledge-sharing events and research of new
                technical solutions. For 1.5 year I've served as my team's <strong>Scrum Master</strong>,
                introducing best practices and helping increase our productivity.

                I have developed multi-language <strong>WordPress websites</strong> with plugins
                such as WooCommerce or Advanced Custom Fields. I&nbsp;customised their functionality,
                admin panel and front end. I&nbsp;used <strong>svg.js, AOS</strong> and <strong>particles.js </strong>
                to enhance user experience. I&nbsp;have been actively involved in the creation process
                and co-operated closely with the designer and clients.

                My main responsibility was creating landing pages, templates and stylesheets,
                and extending functionalities of existing projects.
                I&nbsp;worked with various <strong>Content Management Systems</strong> (WordPress, Django, Dancer)
                and <strong>JavaScript libraries</strong> (jQuery, Backbone.js, Underscore.js)
                I&nbsp;used <strong>Git for version</strong> control daily.
                I&nbsp;was introduced to <strong>AMP</strong> and used it for internal projects.
                During my work at Sidnet I have learnt how to approach complex projects
                and go through various stages of web development.

                I was a camp director and a&nbsp;supporting mentor during two summer camps for children.
                I&nbsp;successfully conducted programming classes for children aged 7 - 15, teaching them
                languages (such as Scratch and JavaScript) and other STEM activities.
                Explaining coding to children helped me understand its concepts better.
