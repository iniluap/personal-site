        <p>
          I am a self-taught frontend developer with experience in a&nbsp;corporate setting and freelance projects.
          I&nbsp;love experimenting with CSS and learning new JavaScript skills.
          I&nbsp;am passionate about learning and giving others opportunities to learn.

          In the course of my career, I was lucky to work on various projects, based on various frameworks and programming languages.
          But what drives me is to create a&nbsp;unique and top-notch experience for users.
